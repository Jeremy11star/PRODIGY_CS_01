Python implementation of the Caesar Cipher algorithm, created during the Prodigy InfoTech Cyber Security Internship.

# PRODIGY_CS_01: Caesar Cipher Implementation (Task-01)

## 🎯 Project Goal
This project is Task 01 of the Cyber Security Internship at Prodigy InfoTech.
The goal was to create a Python program capable of encrypting and decrypting text messages using the classic Caesar Cipher algorithm.

## ✨ Features
* Encryption and Decryption: Supports both operations.
* Case Handling: Preserves the case of letters (e.g., 'A' encrypts to an uppercase letter, 'a' encrypts to a lowercase letter).
* Non-Alphabetic Characters: Ignores and preserves spaces, numbers, and punctuation.
* User-Driven Interface: Prompts the user to select the operation (E/D), input the message, and enter the shift key.

## 🛠️ Technology Used
* Language: Python
* Algorithm: Caesar Cipher

## 🔑 How to Run
1.  Save the code: Save the provided Python script (caesar_cipher.py) to your local machine.
2.  Run in Terminal/IDE (Thonny): Execute the script using a Python interpreter:
    ```bash
    python caesar_cipher.py
    ```
3.  Follow the Prompts: The program will prompt you to enter 'E' for Encrypt or 'D' for Decrypt, the message, and the shift value.

## 💡 Example Usage
* Input Message: `Van Basten`
* Shift Value: `14`
* Result (Encryption): `Job Poghsb`
